Plan:

Create Logo, favicon, title image on canva
Style navbar - white w/ shadow
Style page
Add form
Add bottom
Add footer

- done

Step 2:

Form fields accept numbers only
when submit, table appear, the table is not on the screen originally

the table needs to resize as it grows to always fit on the page

set a threshold of max numbers

error message for character and numbers above threshold

reset bottom to clear page

separate html

JS:

on click trigger calculation and show secondary html
multiply multiplicant x multiplier, from and to # given, incremented by 1:
Multiplier from: 5, to: 8
then its 5, 6, 7, 8 on the table

use bootstrap table

logic:
get table fields, increment while placing the numbers


- bug:
table generating when all fields are empty
- separate alert into a different function to reuse it
validate code
